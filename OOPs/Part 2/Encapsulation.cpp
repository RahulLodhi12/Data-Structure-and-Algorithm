/*
Encapsulation :â€“ 
1. Wrapping data and functions into a single unit.
2. In fully encapsulated class, all the data members are marked private, provide data hiding feature.
3. Encapsulation <-> Information hiding/ Data hiding

Advantage :-
1. Data hiding through private data member, increase security.
2. By encapsulation, we can make class read-only.
3. Encapsulation code is better for unit testing.
4. Code Reusability
